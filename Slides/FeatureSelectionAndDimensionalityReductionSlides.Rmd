## Single Cell RNAseq Analysis Workflow

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/workflow.svg')
```

## Why dimensionality reduction?

* Simplify complexity, so it becomes easier to work with (reduce the number of features/genes).

* Remove redundancies in the data

* Identify the most relevant information (find and filter noise)

* Reduce computational time for downstream procedures

* Facilitate clustering, since some algorithms struggle with too many dimensions

* Data visualization 

## There are many dimensionality reduction algorithms
